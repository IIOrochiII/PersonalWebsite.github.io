How i learnt about LOTR series
</h1>
<p> 
I first stumbled upon Tolkien's books when I was just a child.
I thought they are quite fascinating, but man years later i couldn't believe 
how complicated they really were

Review
</h1>
<p>
<h2>Plot</h2>
So Lotr is series of hobbit named Frodo, who is bearer of ring
that was made by the main villain in series Sauron, he goes with 
his team made of hobbits,humans,elf,dwarf to destroy it once and forever.
He starts from Shire then goes through the woods of elves,Rohan and many more
fascinating lands and it all feels so good because there is balance between action
and coozines, nothing feels beeter than campfire at the end of the day.
<h2>My opinion</h2>
I guess everybody knows this story but i could reread it for years and it's still
refreshing, guess what there is full encyclopedia named Silmarilion in which full
lore of Tolkien's world is written. Tell me who is the other madlad that could 
do something like that
